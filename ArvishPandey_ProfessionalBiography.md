## 🧠 Project Sought

For Senior Design, I don’t want “just a project.” I want something audacious — something that fuses AI, systems design, and real-world impact. I thrive in high-pressure, high-visibility builds, where the line between research, engineering, and product blurs.  

If it’s ambitious, interdisciplinary, and likely to draw a crowd at Expo, I’m all in.
